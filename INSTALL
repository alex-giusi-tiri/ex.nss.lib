libnss-sqlite
=============

libnss-sqlite is a library which can be used to provide authentication
services using entries stored in a SQLite database. It has been tested
on a system with ~5k users and ~6k groups and has pretty good perfs
(less than one secon for an id xxxx). It is a good solution to mirror
a remote authentication database periodicaly updated avoiding connection
cost.

Last version is available from libnss-sqlite.tuxfamily.org.
Debian packages will be available soon.

 1. Prerequisites
------------------

You'll need a libsqlite (version 3) package and matching headers if you want
to build libnss-sqlite.

 2. Installation
-----------------

cd libnss-sqlite/
./bootstrap.sh
./configure CFLAGS='-O2'
make
sudo make install

Generated libraries will be placed in /lib. You can overwrite this setting
by passing --libdir or --prefix to configure.

Since version 0.2, libnss-sqlite can use two different files. One should be
world readable, and can be specified through --with-passwd-db=/path/to/passwd,
it will contain general users information (uid, name) and groups and defaults
to /var/db/passwd.sqlite. The second should be accessible to root only, it can
be specified through --with-shadow-db=/path/to/shadow, it will contain users'
passwords and defaults to /var/db/shadow.sqlite.
